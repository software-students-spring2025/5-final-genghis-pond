            We believe in the preservation of all species by means of observation and algorithmic recognition. Our goal is to
            educate others and foster a community of biology enthusiasts using modern technology.

            <br>
            At Genghis Pond, we are deeply committed to ethical practices in the development and use of our animal identification technology. We believe that technology should be used to promote education, conservation, and responsible wildlife engagement.

            Our app tracks biodiversity, observes migration patterns and population changes, and helps document rare or endangered species.

            <br>
            All images processed by our platform are treated with strict respect for privacy and intellectual property rights. Additionally, our identification models are designed to support ecological awareness and scientific learningâ€”not to disrupt natural habitats or encourage invasive practices. We actively work to ensure our tools are used in ways that benefit both animals and the people who care about them.
